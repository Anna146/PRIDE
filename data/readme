We provide the following data

1) `allowed_labels.txt` - the list of final labels used for prediction

2) `best_split.txt` - the best split into 5 folds generated by random sampling described in the paper. The sets of the movies in each fold are disjoint and the label counts are balanced throughout the folds.

3) `character_indexing.txt` - dict mapping (character1, character2, movie) tuples to their unique indixes

4) `configs` - contains the best configs for all models found in the grid search

5) `dimensions.csv` - the input data for training the model for predicting interpersonal dimensions, described in [Rashid et al.](https://aclanthology.org/D18-1470.pdf). Provides the labels for each of 11 dimensions on the utterances from Friends series.

6) `embeddings` - contains embeddings for initializeing embedding layers in the baseline models

7) `movie_characters_imdb_age_gender.txt` - contains imdb information about ages and genders of the actors who starred in the movies, which is used as a proxy for the biographical information of the characters they played.

8) `movie_gt.txt` - ground truth labels for considered pairs, which are obtained from the aggregated MTurk annotations 

9) `names.txt` - list of personal names which we removed from the training data to avoid overfitting

10) `rares.txt` - list of words that are rare (present in less than 2 movies) and thus are removed from the input data to avoid overfitting

11) `relatioship_list.txt` - the full list of considered relatioships (the initial list given to the mturkers to label)

12) `text_movies` - diectory containing the input texts. Each movie is represented as a folder, containing the files for each character pair. In each pair's file there are only the utterances of this particular pair, separated by scene.
